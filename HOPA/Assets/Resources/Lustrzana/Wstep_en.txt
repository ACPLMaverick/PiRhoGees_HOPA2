The former ballroom is one of the two most prestigious rooms of the Poznański Family Palace. Today known as the Mirror Hall, it still serves as a place for important ceremonies and cultural events. Due to the excellent acoustics, it is often used as a concert hall.
In addition to the large dance floor, to two wells are located to the sides, facing each other, which could serve as a lodge or a stage (the latter permanently installed in one of them). Above them are balconies closed with a semicircular arc and a railing with decorative bars. The whole room is illuminated not only with mirrors, gilding and brightly colored walls, but also wide windows. During the Nazi occupation, the hall was significantly rebuilt. It was divided into two on the level of the prominent, heavy cornice. The lower section was adapted for offices and smaller rooms. As a result of this division the original design of the walls was completely destroyed. It has been reconstructed based on archival photographs, so it was only possible to restore its character and appearance of individual elements: the shape of the mirrors, sconces and chandeliers.
The upper part, preserved in its original state, is decorated in the Empire style: above the cornice, between the oval windows, the walls are filled with gilded decoration with a wreath motif, interwoven with ribbon with a bow and a garland of fruit and flower. The whole room is covered with a flat mirror ceiling, the central part of which is covered with a uniform blue plane meant to imitate the firmament.
