Samuel Hirszenberg, brother of Leon and Henry, was born on 10 July 1865 in Łódź, and died on 15 November 1908 in Jerusalem. His father Dawid had a small weaving manufacture together with Saul Fryszman; his mother’s name was Pearl Sura Awner. In 1877-1881, he studied at the Łódź School of Crafts, showing a remarkable talent for drawing. In 1881, with the help of Dr. Mieczysław Cohn, he received a modest monthly stipend of 25 rubles from industrialists Izrael Poznański and Markus Silberstein, and enrolled at the Krakow Imperial and Royal Academy of Fine Arts, to train under Feliks Szynalewski, Izydor Jabloński and Władysław Łuszczkiewicz. He was interested in literature and philosophy. While studying in Kraków, he met Marian Wawrzeniecki, who became his life-long friend. In 1883-1887, he continued his education at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, training under Alexander Wagner and eventually graduating with honors. While living in poverty as a student, he contracted a chronic disease of the stomach. He painted symbolic, realistic images, for which he received numerous letters of praise and honorable mentions. In 1889, after winning a silver medal for Yeshiva (A Talmudic Feast) and the right to have his works exhibited hors concours at the Exposition Universelle in Paris, he enrolled at the Filippo Colarossi’s academy. While studying there, he came across the principles of Impressionism for the first time. 
	He settled permanently in Łódź, although he traveled extensively, visiting, for example, Paris and Rome, where he painted numerous modernist free-form genre scenes and landscapes. In Munich, on 16 December 1896, he married a French poet, Anna Maria Paulina Chrétien de Bore, who converted to Judaism and adopted the name Dinah. After his debut in 1885, he had his paintings exhibited in Warsaw, Krakow, Łódź, Munich and Paris. Among the many honors he received for his paintings, the most often rewarded was his Saturday Siesta ex aequo with Olga Boznańska’s work at the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts (1895) and then the Society of Friends of Fine Arts in Krakow (1896). Another highly praised work of his was The Little Conference, lauded, for example, at the competition organized by the weekly “Tygodnik Ilustrowany” in Warsaw (1893). Hirszenberg won another medal, this time bronze, for his monumental composition Ahaswer (The Wandering Jew) at the Exposition Universelle in Paris (1900). In addition to the symbolic paintings featuring philosophical and national themes, such as Uriel Acosta and Young Spinoza, Urania, Golus (The Exiled), The Black Banner, Spinoza Accursed, he also painted portraits, genre scenes, landscapes and compositions that decorated the offices of his patrons. Just before the revolution of 1905 he moved with his family to Krakow. In 1907, he accepted an offer to take up a professorial position at the “Bezalel” school of applied arts in Jerusalem. A sudden relapse led to a premature death of the artist.
